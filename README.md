## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
Users should be able to:
​
- Know how to use APIs, requests a key, impliment it into Javascript
- Use Javascript and Jquery to change the HTML and add events
- Impliment CSS to formating
- Create a HTML file using proper layout

## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript and Jquery
- APIs
​
### What I learned
​
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
​
This challenge was quite literally a challenge to complete. It was a great learning experience to actually work with a more complicated form of APIs and correctly implementing them into Javascript. Also I'm starting realize I need to reread the acceptance criteria as I thought the city buttons were supposed to be fixed to refer back to and not be stored locally to appear when searched.
​
### Continued development

I will definitely be coming back to this challenge in my free time to get it as perfected as possible. I really like the use of Jquery as an alternated to plain Javascript. Even though it was not completed right now, I understand where I need to work on and improve. My lack of skill in creating Javascript is holding me back here even though I comprehend what needs to happen and could probably break down the full correct code.

### Useful resources

- (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/) - all of Bootstrap is very nice but when it comes to creating many container/rows/collumns this is very nice
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - helped with color change in the top banner
- (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys) - life saver for figuring out the weather API
